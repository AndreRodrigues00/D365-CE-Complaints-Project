# D365-CE-Complaints-Project
# D365 Complaint Management App

## Overview
This project is a model-driven app built on Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform to automate complaint management. It includes:
- Logging complaints with geolocation lookup and inspector assignment.
- Round-robin assignment of complaints to inspectors using a custom Dataverse plugin.
- Automated email notifications for inspectors and residents using Power Automate.

## Features
- **Complaint Logging**: Residents can log complaints with their email, details, IP address, and timestamp.
- **Geolocation Lookup**: Captures latitude and longitude from the IP address using [ipgeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/).
- **Round-Robin Assignment**: A custom plugin assigns complaints to inspectors in a round-robin fashion.
- **Notifications**: Inspectors receive an email when assigned, and residents are notified when their complaint is actioned.
- **Complaint Counts Dashboard**: Visualises complaints per user using embedded Power BI reports.
